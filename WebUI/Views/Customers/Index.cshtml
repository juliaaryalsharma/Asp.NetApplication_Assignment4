                            Customer service has always been a prerequisite to success in the hotel industry, but in this social media era where everyone acts as a publisher, there is additional marketing value to being remarkable. Getting the basics right, but also looking to create.<br><br>
                            “SMOKJ is about giving great service in a relaxed way,” says Kangryong Choi, General manager of the SMOKJ Hotel Inc. on Wall Street. “A host’s job is very different [than a front-desk clerk’s]. They are supposed to be like the conductor of a symphony. We want them to anticipate your needs when you check in, make you relaxed, and be the person you call throughout your stay when you need help.”
